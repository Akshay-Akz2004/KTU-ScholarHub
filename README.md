# KTU Scholar Hub

## Project Overview
KTU Scholar Hub is an online platform designed to empower students by connecting them with instructors for skill-sharing, specifically through short-term courses aimed at exam preparation. This platform fills the current gap for a student-friendly service where skills can be monetized, allowing students to upskill themselves and instructors to offer targeted educational content.
